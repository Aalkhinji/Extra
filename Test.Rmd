This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
##Q:1 x and y are two datatable in R , join the two table in one command.
```{r}
library(data.table)
x <- data.table(a=c(3:5), b=c(13:15))
y <- data.table(b=c(12:14), d=c(2:4))
x
y
setkey(x,"b")
setkey(y, "b")
x[y, nomatch=0]
```


##Q:2 z is datatable in R with three columns.Write a one line command to compute the averagegrade for each student by assignment type and sort it by grade from high to low.
```{r}
n <-100
z <- data.table(student_name=sample(letters,n,replace=TRUE), grade=rnorm(100,mean=70, sd=10), assignment_type=c(1:98, n, replace=TRUE))
z[,list(mgrade=mean(grade)), by= (assignment_type)][order(mgrade)]
```

Aisha, you might try something like this to group by both student name and 
assignment type and sort by grade decreasing from highest to lowest:

```{r}
# Students Example

library(randomNames)
library(data.table)

n <- 200
z <- data.table(
    student_name=as.factor(sample(randomNames(40), n, replace=TRUE)), 
                           grade=rnorm(n, mean = 70, sd=5), 
                           assignment_type=as.factor(sample(1:10, n, replace=TRUE)), 
                           key="student_name")
str(z)
grades <- z[, list(meangrade=mean(grade)), 
            by=.(student_name,assignment_type)][order(meangrade, decreasing = TRUE)]
summary(grades)
grades
```

##Q:3 Let E be an expressionSet in R, how would you retrive the expression.
```

##ExpressionSet
exprs(E), fData(E), pData(E)

```




##Q:4 Design matrix in limma, what contrst would you test?
```
library(limma)
mm <- model.matrix(~day+subject, eSet)
```

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
##Q:1 x and y are two datatable in R , join the two table in one command.
```{r}
library(data.table)
x <- data.table(a=c(3:5), b=c(13:15))
y <- data.table(b=c(12:14), d=c(2:4))
x
y
setkey(x,"b")
setkey(y, "b")
x[y, nomatch=0]
```


##Q:2 z is datatable in R with three columns.Write a one line command to compute the averagegrade for each student by assignment type and sort it by grade from high to low.
```{r}
n <-100
z <- data.table(student_name=sample(letters,n,replace=TRUE), grade=rnorm(100,mean=70, sd=10), assignment_type=c(1:98, n, replace=TRUE))
mgrade <- mean(grade)
z[,list(mgrade), by= (assignment_type)][order(mgrade)]
```

##Q:3 Let E be an expressionSet in R, how would you retrive the expression.
```{r}

 ##ExpressionSet
exprs(E), fData(E), pData(E)

```




##Q:4 Design matrix in limma, what contrst would you test?
```{r}
library(limma)
mm <- model.matrix(~day+subject, eSet)
```

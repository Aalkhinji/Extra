##Q:1 x and y are two datatable in R , join the two table in one command.
```{r}
library(data.table)
x <- data.table(a=c(3:5), b=c(13:15))
y <- data.table(c=c(17:19), d=c(20:22))
x
y
setkey(x,"A")
setkey(y, "A")
x[y, nomatch=0]
```


##Q:2 z is datatable in R with three columns.Write a one line command to compute the averagegrade for each student by assignment type and sort it by grade from high to low.
```{r}
z <- data.table(student_name=c(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j), grade= c(80:90), assignment_type=c(1:10))
z[,lsit(mgrade=mean(grade)), by= "assignment_type"][order(mgrad)]
```

##Q:3 Let E be an expressionSet in R, how would you retrive the expression.
```{r}
library(limma)
library(Biobase)
library(data.table)

 ##ExpressionSet


```




##Q:4 Design matrix in limma, what contrst would you test?
```{r}
library(limma)
mm <- model.matrix(~day+subject, eSet)
```
